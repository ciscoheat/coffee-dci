Coffee-DCI is a library for javascript programming using the DCI paradigm.

For more information about DCI, please see [this very descriptive document](http://www.artima.com/articles/dci_vision.html), [DCI questions on Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dci) or the [object-composition](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/object-composition) group for detailed discussions. For a specific C# implementation, see [this blog post](http://horsdal.blogspot.se/2009/05/dci-in-c.html).

Note that you need only the contents of the "src" folder to use coffee-dci. The Visual Studio project is only there because I'm using [Web Workbench](http://www.mindscapehq.com/products/web-workbench) to get auto-compilation of Coffeescript.
